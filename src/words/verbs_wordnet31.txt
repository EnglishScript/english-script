Instructions for modifying the verbs_wordnet31.csv
--------------------------------------------------

Read 1st the following explanation about prepositions with verbs:

    https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Prepositions-with-Verbs.htm
    http://guidetogrammar.org/grammar/phrasals.htm

The WordNET 3.1 SQLite database contains both Prepositional verbs and Phrasal verbs.

For now we support only Separable Phrasal Verbs and Inseparable Phrasal Verbs (Transitive) and 
Intransitive Phrasal Verbs, but not yet the Three-Word Phrasal Verbs (Transitive).

If the verbs_wordnet31.csv does not exit yet then follow the instructions in README_WordNET.txt
to create it.

Then repeat the following for each of the lines in the original verbs_wordnet31.csv:

1. If the next line has more than two words then comment the line (to indicate that it is
   not supported yet):

   e.g. "make up one's mind" -> "# make up one's mind"

   Then continue from step 1.

2. Else check if the second word in the line is an adverb or a preposition e.g. "turn on",
   "hold on", "move in", "turn around". If not then comment the line (to indicate that
   it is not supported yet):

   e.g. "make sure" -> "# make sure"

   Then continue from step 1.

3. Else copy the line and go to Google Translator (https://translate.google.com/) and
   select English language as source and e.g. Finnish (or other language you understand)
   as target.

4. Paste the line (i.e. "turn on") to see if it has different meaning as a Verb
   compared with only the verb (i.e. "turn"). E.g.

     Google Translator:

       English:    Finnish:

       "turn on"   "laittaa päälle"/"käynnistää"/...
       "turn"      "kääntää"/"kääntyä"/...

5. If no then comment the line with "#" at the start of the line i.e. "# turn on"
   and continue to step 1. (Well, clearly "turn on" and "turn" mean different things
   as Verbs).

6. If yes then try to see if the second word (i.e. "on") is an adverb or a preposition.

7. If it is an adverb then skip the line and continue to step 1 ("on" in "turn on" must be
   an adverb since it is the opposite of the adverb "off" in "turn off").

8. If it is a preposition (e.g. "in" in a line "move in") then try to see if
   an object can be between the two words without changing the meaning (e.g. "move it in"
   does not mean the same anymore i.e. transferring it inside v.s. changing your
   home/office location).

9. If no then add "+" in front of the preposition e.g. "move +in". This will tell the
   add_verbs.py Python script that "in" in "move in" is a preposition and it has to
   be always right after "move" verb to be treated as part of the meaning.

10. If yes then add "-" in from of the preposition e.g. "brush -on". This will tell the
    add_verbs.py Python script that "on" in "brush on" is a preposition and it do not need
    to be right after "brush" verb to be treated as part of the meaning.


Some examples:

E.g. "turn on":

  1. it is two words
  2. "on" is an adverb since the opposite meaning of "turn on" is "turn off" where "off"
     is an adverb.
  3. Google...
  4. "turn on" and "turn" as verbs mean different activity.
  6. "on" is here an adverb (see explanation in step 2).
  7. keep the line as it is.

  Example use:

  "turn on the light" - i.e. to switch electricity on for the light
  "turn it on" - i.e. to start its engine
  "turn on" - i.e. to get excited
  "turn" - i.e. to switch direction or to rotate something
  "turn on it" - no meaning

E.g. "hold +on"

  1. it is two words
  2. "on" is here a preposition :

  hold on to it - i.e. to grap it and hold it
  hold it - i.e. to keep it steady or keep it in your hand
  hold on - i.e. to wait
  hold it on - no meaning

E.g. "turn around", where "around" is an adverb:

  turn it around - i.e. to rotate it 180 degrees
  turn around - i.e. to rotate (you) 180 degrees
  turn around it - no meaning

E.g. "brush -on", where "on" is here a preposition (marked with "-" to indicate that
there can be anything between the words "brush" and "on" and that "on" is a
preposition, not an adverb ("on" as a word is both an adverb and a preposition):

  brush it (carefully) on the surface
