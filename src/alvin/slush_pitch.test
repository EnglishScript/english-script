<Do you try to communicate with your machines?

<A problem is that there aren't a common language /*that*/ /*both*/ between humans and machines/* would understand*/.
<Machines understand only programming languages and humans understand human languages.
<Machines understand numbers.
<Machines understand physical things or abstract things.
<You need to make humans and machines/* to understand each other*/.  
<Simua /*has*/ created a common language to use between humans and machines.
<Someone calls the common language as "EnglishScript".
<EnglishScript is a human language and a programming language.
<EnglishScript is a language that humans and machines understand.
<EnglishScript is a simplified version for an english language.
<Simua used EnglishScript to create me.  
<Simua puts me to your mobile phone to be as your personal assistant.
<I am a baby.
