?<Hi.
?<My name is "Alvin".
?<The name is "Alvin".
?<I am an artificial intelligence.
?<I am your friend. I help you/*TODO: out*/.

>Register the robotic arm.
<Ok.
<Register a mechanical model for the robotic arm.
>Ok.
>Move the robotic arm to me.
<Ok.
<Move the robotic arm to you.
>Ok.
<What is a target angle of the 1st servo motor of the robotic arm?
>10 degrees.
<What is a target angle of the 3rd servo motor of the robotic arm?
>30 degrees.
<What is a target angle of the 5th servo motor of the robotic arm?
>50 degrees.
<What is a target angle of the 2nd servo motor of the robotic arm?
>20 degrees.
<What is a target angle of the 6th servo motor of the robotic arm?
>60 degrees.
<What is a target angle of the 4th servo motor of the robotic arm?
>40 degrees.
<Start /*FIXME:*/moveing the robotic arm.
>Ok.
